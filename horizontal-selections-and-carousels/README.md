Horizontal selection and simple carousel use similar structures - arbitary JSX sections and a corrisponding hook - to show data.

They both render item at 0 first

the main difference is that horizontal sections also takes an array of options to select the sections. Meanwhile, the carousel just uses arbitrary dots and arrows to give a selection option.
